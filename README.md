# (3-3)-isogenies
This is an optimization of the hash function based on (3,3)-isogenies between superspecial p.p.a.s. implemented by Wouter Castryck and Thomas Decru in their paper 'Multiradical Isogenies' and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/Multiradical-Isogenies).

- The file 33hash.txt contains an optimized magma code of CGL hash function based on (3,3)-isogenies between superspecial abelian surfaces.
